# Approach:
# - Iterate through nums and group consecutive numbers into sublists (curr).
# - If numbers are consecutive, keep extending the current group.
# - If not, save the group into ranges and start a new one.
# - After building ranges, format them into strings:
#     - Single number becomes "x"
#     - A range becomes "x->y"
# - Return the final list of string ranges.
